Based on the above results, here's what you need to do:

1. If you found a namespace ID for "Hanni Email Backups":
   - Save that namespace ID
   - We'll update the script to use it

2. If the folder is only visible as a regular folder:
   - The team folder might not be fully set up
   - Try adding more team members to it
   - Or we can use the regular path approach

3. Next steps:
   - Run this script and send me the output
   - I'll update backup.py with the correct configuration
   - The backup will then go to the team folder
